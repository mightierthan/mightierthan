 +
+*It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still*.

+*By her brother's graveside, Liesel Meminger's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is "The Grave Digger's Handbook," left there by accident, and it is her first act of thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordion-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found*.
+
+*But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up and closed down*.
+
+The subject matter of The Book Thief is heavy. Really heavy. So much so, it makes me wonder how best to approach it. Never mind the task that Brian Percival has been set in filming it. 
+
+I fancied a reread before I saw the film; I was a teenager for my first read-through and have only vague remembrances of something powerful that left me with lingering feelings of a sort of disturbed awe. For the second read-through, I remembered why.
+
+Zusak has fashioned his words with a weight that is rare in young adult fiction today. His words evoke a love of the letter that the bibliophile can appreciate, and his characters also exhibit a passion and appreciation for the power of writing that readers can instantly relate to.
+
+Letters, in their infinite variations, have a near physical presence in this narrative, and it’s a captivating thing to read. These characters do not merely speak their dialogue; they utilise them as tangible objects that must be handled with care. Zusak continually describes speech as being thrown, released, and dropped. Words make up the world, and should be pieced together responsibly. Because when they are set free, they cannot be taken back, and their impact is long-lasting.
+
+This attitude could be due in some part, arguably, to the uniquely ghoulish narrator of The Book Thief, ethereal and disembodied as he is. Is a novel about the Holocaust narrated by Death clever or distasteful? I don’t have the authority to answer that, nor do I think there’s a definite answer, but I find it intriguing, whatever else it is. From the easy pliability with which he treats time, to his philosophising over death and the human soul, to his arrogance concerning the limits of the reader and the things one cannot know. It’s unusual, it’s different, and it worked for me. 
+
+Nevertheless, as with everything else in this novel, it might not do the same for you. For what can be said with any certainty about a novel that takes artistic licence with one of the worst tragedies in human history? The story is a moving one, and its characters are skilfully drawn:
+
+Liesel is convincing and likable from the start. Hans and Rosa are both charming and comforting familial presences. Max has a kindness that renders his relationship with Liesel a loving and happy one. Tommy’s comic relief lightens the darkness of Nazi Germany and its oppressive atmosphere.
+
+As we see Liesel grow to be a thief of books and a girl of improbable circumstance, the tale darkens and tensions heighten, yet the beauty of the characters and the ways they relate to one another remain intact. There’s affection and kindness in these unassuming people, and a great bravery in the face of desperate odds and overwhelming opposition. Zusak renders these otherwise insignificant lives extraordinary against a background of inconceivable scale, and so their actions are permeated with an air of destruction and grief irrespective of what they do.
+
+Because even if Liesel does not, we know. 
+
+And so we have a tale that uses real-life genocide as a means of generating drama with contrived characters and retailing a text for the amusement of the masses. How do you take that? Of course, the novel never aims for strict realism. From its morbid narrator to its streamlining of characters to the ‘good vs evil’ stereotype, this is a fiction that abuses, notwithstanding authorial intention, the difficulties and terrors of millions. Is it a plea to remember the cruelty that humanity is capable of, lest we forget? To appreciate the selflessness that these self-same people can display? Is it a ploy to make a quick buck using a premise known to sell, bolstered by a gimmicky narrator that – let’s be honest, here – is ultimately not really needed?
+
+After all, the lack of linearity and the waxing lyrical of the mysteries of the beyond is not truly vital to telling this story of a girl and her books. Death’s continual analysis of humanity can be preachy, and is only really needed due to the unearthliness of the character. And downright telling us of the forthcoming deaths of certain characters could appear to be some form of clever manipulation of the usual writing process, but can also look like a clear effort to manipulate the reader’s feelings.
+
+This is what ultimately makes me think. All creative writing is manipulation, but when it’s done obviously, and with painfully real catastrophes of the past, the notion feels slightly sordid, and things get morally murky. 
Despite all this, however, The Book Thief is fundamentally a story, and a good one. It moved me despite its unnerving context and emotional puppetry. Zusak is a skilled writer who uses his words to amazing effect, and I do love what he’s done with this one.
+
+And I’m not sure what to do with that opinion. Because for me, the question remains: What can, and should we take away from a novel with such a powerful context?
+
+I’m at a loss.
