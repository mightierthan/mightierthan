In the old wild days of the world there was a king of England known as Uther Pendragon; he was a dragon in wrath as well as in power. There were various regions in his kingdom, many of them warring one against another, and so it came about that one day he summoned a mighty duke to his court at Winchester. This nobleman was of Cornwall, and he was called Duke of Tintagel; he reigned over a western tribe from the fastness of his castle on the rocks, where he looked down upon the violent sea. Uther Pendragon asked the duke to bring with him to court his wife, Igraine, who had the reputation of being a great beauty, and it was said that she could read the secrets of any man’s heart on the instant she looked at him.

So begins Peter Ackroyd’s adaptation of Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. By the end of the end of the first few pages King Uther has fallen for Igraine, Igraine has twigged, and fled back to Tintagel, simultaneously starting the fatal sequence of events that will bring about the eponymous regal demise. Malory wasn’t one to tiptoe around plot, and Ackroyd follows his lead in his modern English adaptation. 

I’ve always loved the Arthurian legends, even risking destroying that love by taking a few modules in them in my degree. Luckily, I didn’t. Reading Malory, Chrétien de Troyes, and others in their original Old and Middle English brings the story to life by connecting you linguistically to its long forgotten original audience, people who valued pain-staking tailored verse, and rich, musical language. And stories as long as a bible. This is why, I suspect, that so few people have actually read the text that arguably forms a cornerstone of British myth.

Everyone knows King Arthur, Guinevere, and Merlin. Most could rattle off a tale or two; the sword in the stone, the adultery of Guinevere and Lancelot, the quest for the Holy Grail (thank you Disney/Monty Python/Sam Neil). But if there isn’t a movie about it, it’s not worth knowing – especially if there’s over 900 pages of it written in what looks like a decidedly alien language:

See? 

Enter Peter Ackroyd. The Death of King Arthur is a hybrid of translation and retelling. Not completely faithful to the original, especially in the details, but does not compile it into a modern concept of a ‘novel’, as would be tempting, retaining the format of a series of tales filled with sex, violence and everything nice. Everything a fifteenth century courtly audience, and a modern one, love.

Translations such as this usually strive to preserve something of the original style. But it seems to me that Ackroyd is more focused on the content – the stories themselves. Ackroyd removes the flowery adjectives that makes Malory so distinctive, and so the stories can come across as quite flat, lacking the elegance and subtlety of Le Morte d’Arthur. Ackroyd’s language does maintain the formality and ritualistic quality of the original. Malory is infamously repetitive, and Ackroyd captures this without becoming boring. This makes the stories very readable, and gains an attractive ‘story time’ air to it. But with sex and gratuitous violence. (I mean this in the most positive way – see below for another taster which I think conveys the point).

So they rode until they came to a fair lake with placid waters. ‘Look,’ Merlin said. ‘There is your sword.’ And, at that moment, from the surface of the water there emerged an arm clothed in white that in its hand held a shining sword. The air was filled with sweet sounds, and the light from the sword suffused the whole lake. Then Arthur saw a lady sailing towards him in a dark boat; she was wearing a black cape, and her hair was covered with a hood. ‘This is the Lady of the Lake,’ Merlin told him. ‘She lives in a great palace within a cavern. Speak graciously to her, and she will give you the sword.’

There’s not much by way of characterisation. Personalities are outlined with broad brushstrokes and defined by set character traits. Sir Palomides is a talented and strong Saracen knight. He lusts after Isolde. Isolde lusts after Sir Tristram. Sir Palomides hates Sir Tristram. That sums up Sir Palomides. Better than Uther, a key figure whose only distinguishing features are being a talented, strong knight, and being filled with lust and hate. Notice a pattern?

The narrative follows a similar formula. Many events seem to bear no relation to the wider plot. Knights meet other knights at crossroads, castles and pavilions in the middle of woods, discuss, and fight. When there is a larger story, it is one the reader is already familiar with; the quest for the Grail or the final battle of Arthur. 

Fundamental flaws these may seem, if this was a novel. But this is legend. The characters are stereotypes because they are epic. Their actions sometimes make no sense to us because their motivations are not ours but those of romantic figures compelled by romantic passions.

So Griflet took up his shield and spear, and galloped into the wood. When he came up to the spring he saw a richly painted pavilion; beside it was a horse, well saddled and bridled, and on a tree was hanging a shield decorated with all manner of devices. Griflet struck the shield with his spear, and knocked it to the ground. The king came out at once from the pavilion. ‘Fair knight,’ he said, ‘why did you strike down my shield?’ ‘I wish to joust with you.’ ‘You had better not do that,’ the king replied. ‘You are still young. Your might will be no match for mine.’ ‘No matter. I wish to joust with you.’ ‘Since you are so sure of yourself, I have no alternative but to fight. From where do you come?’ ‘From the court of King Arthur.’ So the two warriors fought against each other. 

Here, knights battle because it’s what knights do. It’s part of a chivalric code based on honour and pride which dictates insults must be met with blows. This is a world where at least twice, seriously wounded men make passionate love to their ladies and leave the beds soaked with blood. These are not reasonable people because they do not live in a world of reason.

The ladies are equally not reasonable creatures (clearly, if they let men do that to them). Women’s role around the round table consists almost exclusively of lusting, loving, pining, or dying, for love of their knights. More often, other women’s knights. There is a tale of a magic goblet that spills its liquid if drunk by an unfaithful woman. Only four women of Camelot pass the test. Guinevere is not among that four. She is the principal perpetrator but women throughout the work are constant enablers of the fall of their menfolk. Arthur’s death is a consequence of his seduction by his own half-sister.  Merlin is buried alive by the woman he loves. Lancelot’s fall from grace is a direct result of his adultery with Guinevere. The complete collapse of Camelot is a direct result of Lancelot’s adultery with Guinevere. I could go on. 

Ackroyd depicts an escapist world of adventure and fantasy, but it is one imbedded in a darker reality. Knights seek adventure but usually only find a gruesome end and the ones who triumph are not always the virtuous. Throughout the work, characters are reminded that God rewards the just, but when Lancelot challenges his fellow knights over Guinevere’s honour, it is made clear that Lancelot will fall because of her. The underlying message is that although faith may teach that God grants success to the righteous, experience proves it belongs to the powerful.

The Death of King Arthur is a prime example of classic romance. In its world, life is so fleeting and fragile, all its inhabitants have left is passion. Despite his posturing, Malory understood that chivalry was an fantasy. Malory himself was no knight in shining armour – he was arrested many times, even writing Le Morte d’Arthur in prison. By Malory’s time, knights were figures of the political arena rather than the jousting grounds. He tells of a time past that probably never existed, but which still reflects greatness on an otherwise banal present.

Nowadays, complaints about sex and violence in entertainment are hard to avoid; be they in TV, music, or video games. Malory and Ackroyd give us adventure, romance, heroism, the Holy Grail itself, but in the end it is still a story of sex and violence. King or peasant, all are at the mercy of society and fate, and all we can do is make the best of what we’ve got. The legend of King Arthur retains its power because despite being so distant to our modern day lives, it is still very much universal.
