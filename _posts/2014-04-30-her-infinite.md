As Easter comes to an end and the celebrations of the glorious resurrection of
the Easter Bunny from the grave draw to a close, another celebration is upon us.


This time, it’s a more secular deity whose praises are being sung. There is no
recorded date of William Shakespeare’s birth. Most place it three days before
his baptism on 26th April, 1564, as was tradition. That has not stopped others
from claiming otherwise however, or that he did not author the thirty-nine plays or countless poems attributed to him, or others still who claim he did not exist at all.

But I think I understand why the bard puzzles some people and why so many feel vindicated in such posturing in high-minded blogs and other such gatherings. Shakespeare’s writings are so abundant and his intellectual and artistic abilities so unique and unmatched that, as Harold Bloom put it, the man could be seen as some sort of God.

Bloom, cheerleader of the canon, maintained that Shakespeare “invented the human”. In other words, Shakespeare’s characters do not merely recite their lines but know of what they speak, and can act, and react, to their own and others’ actions.

Shakespeare’s most impressive characters; Lear, Falstaff, Anthony, Hamlet, all have in common their sense of consciousness. As Hamlet attests, “conscience does make cowards of us all”. It is this conscience, however, that gives us our humanity. Our capacity to introspect, to scrutinise our lives and choices.

It could be reasonably said that no author before or following Shakespeare has so profoundly portrayed human consciousness as he. As such, Bloom states, Shakespeare made us what we are, and so could very well be a sort of god.

Herein lies the rub. For me, as for so many women, my reaction to Shakespeare is made problematic by my gender. Virginia Woolf said that “man has Shakespeare and women have not. This is true. It could also be said to be not true. In my last blog I commented on some recent additions to the OED. ‘Dead white male’ (noun) was one such word, describing one ‘*whose pre-eminence is challenged as disproportionate to his cultural significance*’. Both Shakespeare and Bloom have been described as such. How then are women, both inside and outside his works, supposed to react to the consciousness he grants our gender?

Juliet for example, a fan favourite, is vocal, bold, and a true equal to her Romeo. It is she who initiates their relationship, saying of Romeo she will “take all myself” with such frankness that would surely have been conceived as unwomanly speech. And she does speak. And speak and speak. She has one of the highest word counts in the play, and one of Shakespeare’s most vocal female characters.

It is not Juliet’s “womanish tears” that Friar Lawrence scolds, but Romeo’s. It’s Juliet who boldly describes their wedding night, “O, I have bought the mansion of love”. And it’s Juliet who rebels against her father’s arranged marriage, and fakes her own death. The very last words of the play suggest Juliet’s ownership of both her story and “*her* Romeo”. This is Juliet’s play.

It was only during Restoration theatre that women performed the roles written for them on stage, and they also brought about a seismic shift in the presentation and reception of their characters. The prologue to the 1660 *Othello* declared: “I come …To tell you news, I saw the Lady drest /The woman playes to day, mistake me not,/No Man in Gown, or Page in Petty-Coat;/A Woman to my knowledge.” With this began a new, voyeuristic presentation of the female body on stage, and the association of actresses with prostitutes. Juliet’s boldness now becomes immodest, inappropriate.

By a 1744 version of the play, Juliet’s speech with Romeo in the balcony scene has become a transgression. When Juliet refuses to marry Paris, her mother assumes it must be because she has compromised her chastity, “What sensual, lewd Companion of the Night/Have you been holding Conversation with,/From open Window, at a Midnight hour?” Noncompliance has become immoral.

By 1797, in Ann Radcliffe’s retelling of the play, *The Italian*, the female lead is decency itself when she learns that her lover has overheard her on the balcony. She pales, slams the window, and refuses to say a word to him.

As time went on, Shakespeare was progressively adopted to deliver ideals for femininity. Often, this was done in the spirit of educating women, as was the case with Mary Lamb’s *Tales from Shakespeare* (1807). Young women could not access Shakespeare directly (God knows what ideas they could have), but they could know his stories as arbitrated through an educator. Mary Cowden Clarke’s *The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Heroines* (1850) is another example, but it’s noteworthy that each girl’s tale is portrayed as a journey from childhood to marriage. The aim of such education is not, at least on the face of it, to give women expression and valuable identity. Rather, the journey to womanhood modelled is girl to teacher of children to mother.

It is this vein that Cowden Clarke actually blames Juliet’s final demise on her so called lack of proper education. Not provided with any knowledge of appropriate feminine behaviour, Juliet is wilful, outspoken, and confident, and it is these tendencies that lead to her death.

The ‘perfecting’ of Shakespeare’s female characters must have made them more accessible and viable to women. But it also made them simple, silent, and altogether less than what their potential.

So what’s changed, from then to now? The history of women’s struggle with Shakespeare runs parallel with women’s struggle for rights and a voice of their own. It’s a struggle against silence, and finding the strength and the means to speak out regardless. Shakespeare has always been an uncertain arbitrator in this battle. He enhances the image of womanhood whilst he obscures it. It is still too common for women to accept shame as a consequence of speaking our mind, or our voices to be held responsible for our misfortunes, like Juliet. Yet the motive for women still reading Shakespeare’s women is that they are women. Whatever the authorial intention, however that intention has been appropriated, Juliet is ultimately not a nonentity. Whatever else she may be, she is a true woman, and she has a true voice.
