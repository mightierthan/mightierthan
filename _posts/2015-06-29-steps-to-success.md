Why did I press ‘snooze’, I thought as I charged past an alarmingly large year 
8 pupil to be given my first admonishment of the day. “Hello, Miss” came a 
disapproving voice from behind main office desk. The receptionist didn’t 
notice my drenched clothes that told of my travel travails. A lethal dose of 
late buses, rain, and a broken down tram had forced me to gallop half a mile 
to beat the army of children who were trooping relentlessly to school. Over 
time, I’ve learnt that supply work is akin to diving into a freezing cold 
swimming pool. Not even nearly tempting at first but when coerced into it by 
the less than holy trinity of bills, guilt, and Antiques Roadshow, many rewards 
can follow. Here are a few tips and tricks to traverse those treacherous waters.

## Time

Plan your timing carefully. It’s easy to minimise preparation time. ‘I don’t 
know anyone’ and ‘I’m only staying for a day’ are two thoughts always 
encroaching on your mind when considering hitting the snooze button a third 
time. But the last thing you want is to arrive with the students. No time to 
find your way round, no time to discuss the classes, no time to go the 
bathroom, let alone find it. All can come back to bite you. Don’t touch the 
‘snooze’.

## Kick Off

Every book on teaching highlights the importance of the first five minutes. 
Opportunity to define boundaries when students are at their most predisposed. 
Unlike September, when students are keen to impress their new teacher, you get 
a disrupted morning littered with the opportunity to play with the naïve supply 
alien. So what to do? Hit back with a massive attack of positivity. Draw a 
smiley face and a sad face on the board (a tick and cross for KS4 – ‘smileys are 
lame!’). Explain to your charges what kind of actions will win them a smiley 
face. As soon as you’re done, ask the angel in the class (easily spotted by the 
multitude of pens and pencils lined up raring to go on their desk, in order of 
descending size) to write their name under the smiley face. An interested hum 
ensues - ‘Ooh this one means what they say’ – surrounding you in a cloud of 
order and confidence.

## Register

The law is laid down and students are where you want them. Next up is roll 
call. Nowadays school take registers with a program called SIMS (Supply Idiot 
Must Suffer), which without the proper planning, passwords and secret 
handshakes can be a nuisance. Befrore class, get SIMS up and make sure you’re 
signed in, if not, send the aforementioned smiley face student for IT support. 
When you’re in, explain to the class you will be making pronunciation mistakes 
and the sad face will be waiting for anyone who finds them amusing. Choose one 
student to correct you so you aren’t overwhelmed with a tidal wave of 
corrections. When complete, celebrate with a mini fist pump for completing the 
first hurdle on your journey to a calm and happy day.

## Actually Teaching

You should get lesson plans in the morning. These could range from perfectly
planned simplicity to photocopied activity sheets to a hastily scribbled 
post-it note. Unless you 1:are in a perfectly behaved school (unlikely) or 2: 
have superman/woman as your TA (very unlikely), you will need something else up 
your sleeve for when set work is finished/illegible/thrown out the window. 
These ‘golden activities’ should be adaptable for any year group, require no 
resources and no marking. Here’s one English specific example I made earlier:

### Colour Poem
```
Red is
Green is
Blue is
```

Not the most exciting thing they ever did, but it’s accessible to EVERYONE, 
needs no resources and you could even use peer marking to leave no marking for 
you. Ask for metaphors, juxtaposition, or a haiku from your Oscar Wildes; 
capital letters and full stops from your Joey Essexes. It’s simple, but it 
rarely fails. 

## The Afternoon Lull

Food, stress, and friendship dramas can stifle the magic of the smiley face 
after lunchtime. Bring out the big guns with a new bribe, I mean...incentive. 
Draw a circle on the board and tell the class that if five golden minutes are 
won then forget work, the end of the lesson will be spent playing a drama game. 
Cue immense improvement in behavior and bask in the title of best supply teacher 
ever. Before the game, show students one of the letters you have written to 
Miss Perfect and remind the others on the smiley list that they are one good 
example of behavior away from making their mum’s day:


```
Dear Parents/Carers,

Chloe has been a joy to teach today.
She has participated well and been very polite
Well done, Chloe!
Kind regards,

Miss. B
(sign it – kids love that)
```

## The Countdown 

However wonderful your contingent have been, take extra care for the countdown.
With fifteen minutes to go, start planning the end of the day. The drama game
is a guaranteed hit. Don’t be influenced to let it go on so everybody gets a 
turn. Rushing is your enemy here so give yourself enough time to execute your 
evacuation plan without panic. Children tidy the class and then get their coats, 
bags and reading books. Search for the dictator in you and get your line 
organised with military precision. Ultimately, home time is the only time of the
day when you could get in serious trouble as their guardian angel and explain 
this to your class in kiddy language. Children have to be picked up and this 
has to be done in a manner that would make any Health and Safety inspector smile
cheerily (is this possible?). Ensure that every child is picked up by an adult 
that knows them. Repeat this after me: No child leaves your supervision without 
eye contact from the person the child is pointing to! Ignore the infant 
complaints and accept that your class will be the last to disperse but this 
concern is nothing compared to what could happen if you rush. The main pitfall 
is children who go home by themselves. Don’t allow this to happen unless the 
teacher has already given you the green light. If the child does go home by 
themselves then the office can confirm this once the other children have left. 
If you have any doubt play it safe. Take the situation to the office and they 
will take it from there. This is not a time to take risks however desperate you 
are to get to the pub.

## Behaviour 

The elephant in the article. I have intentionally left this to last because if 
you follow the strategies above then you won’t come to much harm. It’s best to 
know about the behaviour of your class as soon as possible. Ask questions on 
arrival. Usually you will get generic responses like “they’re lovely” or 
“they’re fine, so long as you are firm.” This is good news. Alarm bells should 
ring if you hear: “you will be there 3rd teacher this week” or “sorry, there 
are no plans, the teacher has been at home all week with stress.” Time to get 
out the body armour… I have grouped the different types of classes you will 
face into categories.

1. Parish Meeting Class = (“They are lovely.”)  All children respect your role 
	as the leader. You can relax and just worry about teaching them properly.

2. Protest Class = (“You might have to sit on them a bit but they are fine.”) 
	Often these are the best. You have a bit more energy but your authority 
	isn’t questioned. You will have to deal with a little low level behaviour but nothing that can’t be handled.

3. Riot Class = (“The class teacher is very strict with them. There are two 
	children on behaviour reports.”) When asked you will describe this class
	as “Energetic”. Usually there will be one or two children who push at 
	the boundaries and require a sanction to manage them. If this works 
	then you will survive without too much stress but you may have to 
	think about removing them from class if they continue to cause trouble.

4. War Zone Class = (“They are a difficult class. Send out the difficult ones 
	to Mr Strong WHEN they play up.”) There will be numerous children who 
	think they are untouchable because they have got into the habit of 
	doing largely what they want without consequence. There will be 
	calling out, fiddling while your talking and the occasional bout of 
	backchat. Deal firmly with the main perpetrators and the rest 
	should back down.

5. Apocalypse Class = (“Good luck!”) There is nothing more lonely then looking 
	at the clock and seeing 27 minutes remaining… of the first lesson. Let’s leave it at that.

Promise me one thing. Don’t ever let an Apocalyse class make you question your 
competence. The Apocalypse class is created because there is no consistent 
presence and it’s impossible for anyone to become that presence in one day. 
Survival is the only thing on your mind. Find out the behaviour policy and 
ensure you know what happens if the naughty ones push too hard. Above all, 
remember these three rules:

1. Don’t shout. 
2. Don’t touch. 
3. Don’t take it personally.

Self Assessment Supply teaching is challenging. There will be days when you 
come home wondering why you bother. However, the rewards are much greater than 
the odd Apocalypse. There are the discernible benefits: you are involved in the 
best parts of the profession without the mundane. No staff meetings, no 
assessment, no disgruntled parents, no planning (Hallelujah!) and a day that 
ends before 4 o’ clock. But there is also the camouflaged goodness. Unlike the 
vast majority of teachers, you don’t get stuck in one school, adopting the 
same style and approach for the rest of your career. You see an awful lot of 
creative innovative strategies that you can store away for the future as well 
as seeing inspirational managers operating while strutting their stuff in 
assemblies. It also doesn’t take long to cater your lessons to Year groups. 
You learn how to get the best out of a chatty boy in Year 6 on Tuesday and make 
a homesick Year 1 child enjoy a day without their mummy on Wednesday.

Needs and wants are confusing for any teacher. Supply teaching gives you a real 
life breath of experience rather than just reading about it on the TES website. 
You can throw yourself into every strand of education, ranging from Special 
Needs Schools to Pupil Referral Units. The exposure to all educational 
challenges provides an opportunity to pinpoint the next step and puts you in the 
shop window every day. In this way, supply teaching is a mirror. If you are 
brave enough to look into it, you can demonstrate your worth to the school, and 
the school can demonstrate it’s worth to you. One day the two will match and 
you will have found the next opportunity in your educational journey.
