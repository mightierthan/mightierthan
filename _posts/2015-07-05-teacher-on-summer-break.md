You can take the teacher out of the school but you can’t take the school out of the teacher. No matter how hard we try to relax during the summer holidays, there are a few tell-tale signs that set us apart from our civilian friends – do you recognise yourself in any of these?
 
## You have to put up with being told how jammy you are by everyone you know

As the long summer holiday looms you find yourself looking forward to a desperately needed break, but it would be a lot more enjoyable if it didn’t come with a side helping of ‘friendly banter’ from your friends, family and the world at large. Nominally at least, teachers get 13 weeks of holiday per year and the rest of the world doesn’t half harp on about it.  Perhaps they’d like to give up all of their evenings and weekends for the next year before they decide whether we’ve earned our break?

## You wake up at 6.30am on the dot 

The alarm is un-set, the cat is informed that breakfast will be delayed and you get ready for the lie-in to end all lie-ins on the first day of the summer holidays. Only, your body doesn’t cooperate. There is a body-clock conspiracy that sees teachers up and down the country waking up fresh-eyed and bushy-tailed at 6.30am on the dot day after day. You try to go back to sleep but your body just isn’t having any of it. Of course, you’ll have just about got the hang of lazy mornings in time for school to recommence in September.

## You wear a disguise to the supermarket

When school’s out, the last thing you want to do is run into your students. Even the nice ones. But you can’t head to the local supermarket without being treated like a local celebrity so you take to wearing dark glasses and a cap, and visiting only under the cover of night.

## You drag your family off on ‘scintillating’ day trips 

Whilst other families hit the beach or amusement parks, your kids are better acquainted with glass-blowing factories and are forced to learn all about long barrows, chalk escarpments and the local sewage works while you scout possible destinations for next year’s field trips.

## You can’t head out for the day without a full risk assessment

No matter how mundane the trip you have planned for your loved ones, you’ll have undertaken a four-page risk assessment (maybe just in your head, you are on holidays after all) and you’ll have planned the day to the nth degree. You don’t leave the house without a full working knowledge of where toilets, fresh water and first aid can be found en route as well as at your destination.

## Barbecues terrify you

For most people, barbecues are a compulsion the moment the sun shows its face – but they fill you with fear. The teacher in you can’t help but worry about the possibility of people getting burned or poisoned. If you are persuaded to join a barbecue you spend the whole afternoon ensuring that everyone is drinking enough water while proffering hats and sunscreen at them and ‘make sure it’s cooked through’ becomes your mantra.

## For you, summer sales mean only one thing – cheap stationery!
 
While your friends blast their budget on discounted clothing and home-wares, you find yourself heading straight to the stationery section to see whether those beautiful notepads and coloured pens that you’ve been coveting forever are reduced.

## You dread the late August bank holiday rather than looking forward to it

The August bank holiday is a swearword in your household and makes you think of lesson planning and the imminent return to school. Whilst civilians look forward to it, teachers feel a knot in the pit of their stomachs at the very thought of the late August bank holiday.
