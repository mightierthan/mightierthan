Seduced by graphic design, my significant other bought a beautiful copy of Mary Wollstonecraft’s *A Vindication on the Rights of Woman* the other day. It’s a book I’ve been trying to persuade him to read since I first put him off with my 15,000 word dissertation on the subject. Now, our chats have got me thinking. A dangerous thing, indeed. 


The mixed reactions we both had to the work was interesting. Significant other found it a difficult read, finding a contradiction in Wollstonecraft’s righteous rhetoric on the value of women’s ‘virtue’ with her own personal life, which was seemingly filled with the passions she criticised other women for. This was further conflicted by Wollstonecraft’s affirmative plea for women to take command of their own voices and actions.


Now, I’d like to put down some of my own thoughts of *Vindication*, especially considering this ‘fourth wave’ of feminism we are apparently (and hopefully) entering. More on that later. I first read *Vindications* a few years back in University, and I think its commonly held place as one of the founding texts of modern feminism is very rightly deserved. Reading it again, it strikes me that those same arguments for the liberation of (white, middleclass) women are still being both echoed and built on by feminists today.


One particularly notable argument of Wollstonecraft’s is that the growth of a woman’s mind could result in greater fulfilment in her positions as wife and mother. Such a statement seems so of its time, what was a credo of positivity is now widely seen as demeaning and reductive. I by no means agree with Wollstonecraft’s focus on the domestic, and specifically reproductive, role of women. However, it was the most accessible way for women in her day to empower themselves, to utilise their skills and knowledge to form and temper something, a life, purely of their creation.


More than this, I think I can see how this focus on woman’s reproductive powers that represented one of the first major steps in modern feminism is not quite so relegated to the backwaters of time as we might think. Feminism today takes a far more forward approach than Wollstonecraft could have, and this is reflected is many modern feminists’ focus on the physical; specifically sexual and reproductive liberation.


I probably won’t make many friends by saying this, but feminism today is weirdly preoccupied with the pro-vaginal: love me, love my menstruation. A quick search on Etsy, for example, brings up these beauties:

So it seems to me that modern feminism has female empowerment well in hand, and hat. Your admiration of the vulva can be shown loud and proud and anyone who doesn’t like it can just deal. But what would Wollstonecraft think? I doubt she would think wearing a Perspex vagina round her neck would seriously promote her cause. But I think there’s an argument that such projections do support the same female agency she did.


I went to hear Laura Bates, of the Everyday Sexism Project, talk at my local Waterstones the other day and I think she said something that aptly illustrates my point. She spoke of how feminism today was ‘not about marching, not about waving placards. Although those things can be powerful tools, making a difference today is about finding personal ways of shouting back’. And it’s true, when asked many people would claim the battle is won. That women are pretty much equal. More or less. But there will always be those who aim to weaken the strength of the Other, that threatening presence which throws one’s own perspectives into stark relief, not only women but those who are financially, religiously, sexually, or ethnically different.


Wollstonecraft recognises this universality. She proclaims her ‘affection for the whole human race’ and the ‘rights of humanity’ as the driving force of her writing. She also had the sense to see that it would take more than a few overblown displays of female independence to make a lasting impression. It would take thousands of tiny remonstrations, by as many voices as possible, no matter how quiet. Even if this shouting back takes the form of a hot pink, felt lined, cuddly uterus with a smiley face to celebrate womanhood. 


It is these little things which raise valuable awareness of women’s rights, and with awareness comes education. Wollstonecraft was as strong an advocate for educating girls as our most outspoken figures of modern feminism. For then, as now, education was vital for young women to claim the same independence of mind and intellectual faculties encouraged in men. Wollstonecraft condemns how upper middle class girls’ education consisted almost solely of knowledge needed to attract a husband. Contrary to many thinkers of her time, Wollstonecraft identifies this, and not anything innate to female nature, as responsible for the debasement of women and their perceived inferiority to men.


But allow them free reign of their mental faculties, without stereotyped direction or peer pressure, women’s status could be elevated to true equality, their personal happiness greatly increased and society bettered overall. This argument is couched in the terms of Wollstonecraft’s Enlightenment, stating how independence of mind could give women ‘virtue’ and ‘reason’. Strip these context-filled phrases away, however, and Wollstonecraft’s argument is still painfully relevant.


Lego aimed at little girls is based on cooking, shopping and making oneself beautiful. Teenage girls are told not to ‘ask for trouble’ by wearing short skirts or getting drunk rather than being taught about their rights and about consent. Women are still being warded away from stereotypically ‘masculine’ careers such as the sciences, technological industries, law, and politics and receive open discrimination and abuse when they do succeed in breaking the glass ceilings of these institutions.


When such 19th century mentalities are still so much the norm in wider society; trumpeted by powerful corporations and major media, perhaps it makes sense that we use the same retaliation our feminist predecessors did. Wollstonecraft’s Vindications was met with relatively little notice and less praise at the time of publication. Following her death a few short years later it was used as a weapon against her cause. Yet this little book is now recognised as a major facilitator of women’s rights. With voices like Wollstonecraft’s echoing across the centuries, and gender equality closer than ever, the voices raised against them are as strong as ever. Now, more than ever before, do women need to find their own vindication of their rights, be that in reading a book that highlights the issues surrounding them, tweeting their experiences of them first hand, or simply wearing a hat shaped like a vagina.
