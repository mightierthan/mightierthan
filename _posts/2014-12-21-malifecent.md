I love fantasy. Give me spellcasters, knights, dragons, soaring forests and towers, cloaks, unlikely youthful heroes and their elderly wisdom-dispensing guardians, and the curative ability of friendship and love over the powers of darkness. I am on board. So I sat down to Maleficent with hope in my heart that this may break the spell of god awful live-action fairy tale adaptations like Mirror Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman that we’ve been bombarded with these past few years.

These thoughts only dawned on me a while after the fairy dust settled. Once the Day-Glo spectacle of the Moors and Angelina Jolie’s sheer magnetism had worn off, the same old stereotypes poked through. Strange thing is, I don’t really mind. 

The film opens with a good, old fashioned PREMISE. The kingdom of Men hate the kingdom of Fairies because Men are horrible, horrible creatures, and the fairies are not super psyched about Men either because Men are horrible, horrible creatures. 

Enter stage right: Maleficent, a young leader of the fairy folk. She spends her days dishing out her innocent insights, being at one with nature, and admonishing a young human, Stefan, caught thieving a rock from the Pond O’ Jewels before falling deeply in love with said human.

Doomed by the foreshadowing of PebbleGate Stefan promptly grows up to be ‘Howling Mad’ Murdock from The A Team and decides to make a pass at his dying king’s final wish – that whoever kills Maleficent inherits the Kingdom. Because apparently this kingdom has no established rules of succession and being ‘good at murder’ is prime criteria for ideal leadership. 

So Stefan charms his way back into Maleficent’s favour, drugs her, and attempts to kill her. He can’t bring himself to do the deed, however. Instead, he settles for sawing off the wings that give Maleficent her strength and freedom. In other words, in Maleficent, the PG-rated Disney film, a man roofies a fairy and violently takes her ‘wings’ while she’s unconscious.

But don't worry, she’ll later find fulfilment through motherhood. :I

That last one hurt. Do young people of today really need another Aryan princess fantasy set in an archaic Eurocentric medieval world? One of the principal reasons for the existence of fairy tales is to propagate the dominant school of thought at the time: that women are inferior. Sleeping Beauty is an apt example. Princess Aurora is condemned by a woman’s jealous whim. A prick from a phallic symbol puts Aurora into a deathlike sleep; robbing her of her freedom and free will. Only a kiss from her prospective husband can wake her. Mixed messages abound. Positive and negative ideas of male influence on the female body mingle in a story evolved through thousands of retellings by both men and women to their children. 

Despite all this, it’s the film’s genre as a fairy tale that saves Maleficent for me in this respect. It’s a genre I’ve grown up with and have a great fondness for. Fairies are somewhat low on my list of favourite magic-using characters but I’m not here to split hairs. As such, when it comes to fantasy I often unwittingly make quite saddening compromises.

But in the latter half of the film, more interesting subversions come to light, flickers of which the film’s hordes of fans have seen most recently in Frozen: a tale of two women saving themselves through their own power alone.

If anything, Maleficent’s message is even more powerful, as Maleficent’s villain is not the eponymous but the masculine, violent, and repressive dominant society which forces its way into Maleficent’s land, people and body. The event which turns Maleficent to the dark side is not the romantic spurn from Stefan, as threated in the trailer, but his assault of her. The rape subtext isn’t hidden, complete with one of the most powerful screams of loss and sorrow from Jolie that I’ve seen in film. With the theft of Maleficent’s means of physical and emotional liberation, she sinks deeper into darkness, culminating in her curse of King Stefan’s baby daughter, Aurora.

The princess and the fairy are invariably brought together however, through Aurora’s borderline neglectful fairy godmothers. Maleficent subsequently watches over Aurora and reluctantly comes to care for her. In turn, when Aurora finally meets Maleficent and mistakes her for a fairy godmother, she comes to love her. Easy as it is to describe their relationship as mother/daughter or tutor/tutee, it’s more subtle than that. Aurora declares that she longs to live with Maleficent so they can look after one another – not in order to be Maleficent’s daughter. The two certainly become family to one another, but it’s a unique and unconventional one we don’t often see in blockbuster films. And one that makes a very nice change.

As you may guess, it’s Maleficent’s love for Aurora that redeems her, but even this isn’t conventional. The curse, as we know from fairy-tale lore, can only be broken by true love’s first kiss, a failsafe Maleficent includes to taunt King Stefan, as their relationship resulted in both believing such a thing cannot exist. Prince Phillip, consigned to three measly scenes, has a shot at it but fails. True love’s kiss, the writers argue, is nonsense, for a pair of teenagers who know absolutely nothing about each other. True love is knowing someone completely, and that’s why it’s Maleficent, when she kisses Aurora on the forehead when she feels all is lost, that revives her. In return, Aurora restores Maleficent’s wings, kept as a gruesome trophy by Stefan. In the shattering of the glass cage that binds the wings, Aurora frees herself and Maleficent from King Stefan and all he stands for. The two women save each other, and Stefan is destroyed by his own hatred.

You can tell a film’s politics in its last five minutes. It’s when the good are rewarded and the bad punished. Maleficent’s is spent in Aurora being crowned queen of both lands, with Maleficent to watch over her. Together the two women have overthrown the patriarchal system that’s abused them both and reinvented their broken worlds in the image of a loving, united, and unconventional family. Frozen may be progressive, but Maleficent is flat-out radical. The relationship between Maleficent and Aurora doesn’t just save the world, it changes it.
