At last, a teacher is awarded some extra cash and what does she do with it? 
She donates it straight back into her work. Nancie Atwell, an English teacher 
from Maine, USA has received more than just a small bonus going towards buying 
stationary. Atwell has won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize.

Atwell is the creator of the Centre for Teaching and Learning, a private school
in Maine. The school teaches only 75 students, and while it’s nearly $9,000 
annual fees seem pricey, it's about a third of the average cost of private 
schools on the East Coast and the school offers support to almost 
80% of students.

Beyond teaching students, the Centre for Teaching and Learning also serves as 
a base where educators can come for workshops on how to innovate their teaching.

Atwell has promised to use her entire $1 million prize to develop these teacher 
workshops, as well as offering tuition assistance for eligible families, to 
expand the school’s library and upgrade the school’s infrastructure. Worthwhile 
goals indeed, as the Centre for Teaching and Learning sees 97% of its students 
go on to further study.

The group behind the Global Teacher Prize, an award already being described as 
the Nobel Prize of teaching, is The Varkey Foundation, a non-profit organisation 
based in Dubai. The organisation’s founder, Sunny Varkey, became driven to 
initiate a competition to acknowledge the best teachers in the world when his 
research found that China is the only country in the world where teachers are 
granted the same respect and recognition as doctors. Everywhere else, teachers 
are relentlessly undervalued for their role in society. He hopes this annual 
competition will encourage the reversal of that stigma.

This year’s winner is undoubtedly worthy of the award and prize money. Atwell’s 
teaching career spans four decades, during which time she has also written 
several successful books on her teaching approaches. She was nominated for the 
prize by a graduate of her school, as were the almost 5,000 other nominees. 
They hail from all over the world — The U.K, Cambodia, United States, India, 
and Haiti to name a few. The 10 finalists were flown to Dubai for the award 
ceremony. More than 60 education experts selected Atwell as the final winner, 
founded on her proven accomplishments in the classroom and beyond, her 
pioneering educational methods and her efforts to prepare children to be 
successful global citizens.

It’s safe to call Atwell a role model for change in education. She sees national 
assessments as a means of turning teachers into technicians who read from a 
script rather than teach. Real teachers, she believes, need to have the 
creativity to make the curriculum effective for all their students. Rather than 
typical assessments, Atwell’s students develop portfolios to measure their 
progress. Parents see these portfolios at regular meetings to envision their 
child’s growth and help plan student’s next set of objectives.

The results speak for themselves; Atwell’s students read an average of 40 books 
per year that they select themselves, a figure well above the national average. 
It is this notion of allowing students choice in their own learning, Atwell 
argues, which makes the difference. Thanks to the Global Teacher 
Prize competition, teaching models like Atwell’s not only receive praise but 
also attention, in turn hopefully enabling education leaders to choose to 
emulate these models in their own schools.
