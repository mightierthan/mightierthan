This post is about a topic so dangerously sensitive it could be a kitten full 
of dynamite: subject knowledge. And I’m not talking about what students know, 
because that's a conversation that can currently be enjoyed on channel four 
reruns. It's a good conversation, and it needs to happen. But it isn't this one.

 This post is about teacher knowledge. What do you know about what you teach? 
 It can be a disconcerting reflection. For example, I studied English 
 Literature and Language at a great university, and graduated with my BA (Hons) 
 and then my MA. I learned lots about Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825), 
 Thomas de Quincey (1785-1859), and the 100 funniest gags about Fanny Burney 
 (1752-1840). Note that, captivating as these subjects are, none of them 
 particularly prepare you for a Year 7 lesson on the correct usage of a 
 semi-colon, the definition(s) of irony, and the reason why Katniss chooses 
 Peeta over Gale. 

And yet, here I was, teaching just that. Of course, you yell from the gallery, 
you picked this up during your teacher training. Well, no, not particularly. 
I studied for a PGCE, where the belief was that you knew all this already 
and if not, you caught up on your specialty in your own time. Assessment on 
subject knowledge doesn’t come into it. 

In fairness, it could be said that part of the qualification process was the 
requirement to be ‘passed’ by my training schools. But how would they have 
known that I was teaching the right content? The odd observation lesson is all 
well and good, but I could have been talking utter drivel the rest of the 
time: Shakespeare invented Twitter, capital letters are optional, it’s 
perfectly fine for a story to be revealed as just a dream all along, etc. 
The point is that I could be only a page ahead of the students, and no one could 
stop me. Concerning subject knowledge, becoming a qualified teacher can be 
less a gold standard, and more an iron pyrite one.

Naturally, this is a purposefully extreme example. I'm sure most teachers are 
perfectly up to scratch for their tour of duty. English is a funny subject, 
where subjectivity and opinion reign as much as definitive yes or no answers. 
In subjects like maths or science, for instance, there is a far more settled 
body of knowledge that confers expertise on its owner. 

Despite this, there are always quiet conversations in the staff room that 
confess a certain degree of concern amongst teachers of their own subject 
knowledge. Heads of faculty who wouldn't and couldn't teach the A-level, 
teachers coerced by senior staff into teaching outside their comfort zones, 
teachers jack-knifed by the syllabus to teach completely unfamiliar topics, 
primary teachers who are expected to be experts in everything.

None of this is a criticism of teachers. It's a reflection on an industry that 
often doesn't require expertise in its associates in order for them to be 
treated as experts. Here’s the $1-million question: is that good enough as a 
model of education? If you answered, "Sure, why not?", then let me know a good 
time to call, because I have some prime real estate in 
Narnia I want to sell you.

So what’s the solution? I have two ideas, and you're probably not going to 
like them.

Suggestion the first: sit the exam paper yourself and see what you get. If you 
don't crush it, first time, what does that say about your subject knowledge, 
and your ability to communicate that knowledge well? You don't need to know 
everything, but you need to know a heck of a lot more than them.

Suggestion the second: this could amuse or annoy in equal measure. Make it a 
prerequisite of teacher training that teachers sit the papers they'll teach. 
See what they get. We could collate the data anonymously and build one of the 
most controversial and potentially informative data sets ever created. 
How does it compare with student outcomes? Teacher training institutions? 
Demographics? Hiring policies? Oh boy.

How about a third option. Schools: instead of tedious whole-school insets with 
generic, blunt topics that make you feel like jumping off something high, why 
not invest in subject-specific content training? I know a ton of teachers who 
would love that far more than spending another day Building Hives of Learning.

Why not? Yes, it costs money and effort. But seriously, why wouldn't you expect
to be capable of an A in your own subject? Who wouldn't want that? The question
should be: can we afford not to do this?
