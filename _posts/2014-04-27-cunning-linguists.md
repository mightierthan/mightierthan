# Cunning Linguists’ Newest Additions to the OED, and What They Say About English Speakers

In Hartford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen. In Cumbria, Cleveland, and Clwyd, cuntish chuggers can crap shoot Coney Dogs… wait, what?

I have decided to open my very first blog post with something appropriately audacious and striking by talking about the dictionary. A few days ago, the OED released the most thrilling statement a dictionary possibly can: shiny new words have been judged and found worthy to be officially part of the English language. 

At first glance, they may appear to be just a list of new adjectives, nouns and verbs, albeit some bound to be accompanied by a deal of head-scratching. **Crap shoot (n.)**, for instance, is ‘a situation or undertaking regarded as uncertain, risky, or unpredictable’. **Coney Dog (n.)**, is a collection of varied meat products in a bun consumed at a fairground-toting island off New York City. Consider my daily vocabulary expanded.

But words that have been popular enough to warrant inclusion into the OED carry more context than they first seem. What caught my attention while eyeing the list was one particularly pervading theme: women. Check out a few of the new entries and my thoughts on what they say about English speakers.

**bestie (n.)**: *a person’s best friend; a very close friend*.

I heard this a lot amongst the teenage girls in my charge during my recent doomed foray into the world of teaching. What is more surprising is what a great impact young women have on our language. “There is increasingly more recognition for the role that young women play in creating and disseminating slang,” states Katherine Martin, Oxford’s head of U.S. dictionaries, in a recent article. “Women are huge innovators.” Even if those innovations are ending sentences like they’re, like, questions.

**Heroine-worship (v.)**: *to admire (a woman one views as a heroine) intensely, excessively, or uncritically*.

This one’s clearly reminiscent of ‘hero worship’, a phrase in the OED since 1857. “One thing you see a lot when we’re revising is the addition of the female version of something we already have the male version of,” says Martin.

Interestingly, the *heroine/hero* pairing is one of those rarities in which women can fall into either grouping and men can only fall into one: a hero can be a woman, whereas a heroine can’t be a man. Like actor/actress, there is a male version that is perceived as relatively gender neutral and a feminised version. The telling part comes when people choose which version to use—and why they make that choice, like a woman who rejects actress because she feels actor makes her sound like a more serious thespian.

“It’s a 21st century phenomenon to think that anything that is gender-restricted to women is somehow lesser and so, then, to oppose that,” Martin says. But, if female-specific vocabulary makes us feel uncomfortable, doesn’t that mean that to some degree we are buying into the notion that the feminine form is innately lacking? Considering this, women may prefer to be heroines than heroes, seeing it as a word through which they can proudly profess their femininity.

**Dead white male (n.)**: *a dead Caucasian male writer, philosopher, etc., whose pre-eminence, esp. in academic study, is challenged as disproportionate to his cultural significance, and attributed to a historical bias towards his gender and ethnic group*.

The insinuation in this unflattering term is that modern society has had enough of the things dead white men have said and written, especially in academia. If one felt, for example, that Herman Melville’s brilliance was exaggerated, one could refer to Moby Dick as a big fat book by a dead white male about a big fat white sea mammal. 

This one highlights a well-known fact; throughout history, the writings of white European males has been privileged over the work of others. The quite interesting point about it being included in the OED now is that it was included at all. Niche ideas shared by few people don’t make it into the dictionary. That’s to say, the inclusion of the phrase indicates its growing place in those social recesses where said deceased Caucasian gentlemen previously ruled supreme. Such is the power of a dictionary update, on the face on it a mostly dull list of 900 words.

(Speaking of updates and things that are not dull, variations on a word that is especially feminine, so to speak, got a little more space in this year’s dictionary. [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cunt](Here’s a rather fascinating history of that particular term.))

**cunty (n.)**: *adj. despicable; highly unpleasant; extremely annoying*

The C-word’s first appearance in the OED was in 1972, and in England, the thirteenth century; it is believed to have been coined after Gropecunt Lane, a popular street name (and popular street, presumably) in the red light districts of Medieval England.

The word certainly engenders powerful reaction whichever way it is used. In Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues, in an episode entitled *Reclaiming Cunt*, she argues the word to be “something lovely, despite its negative connotations”. Although it will probably never be a word to be bandied around most dinner tables, the use of the word has become less and less of a taboo.

Hence the inclusion of a few charming subsidiaries. To be “cuntish” is to be objectionable. To be “cunted” is to be under the influence. And “cunting” is an intensifier that can add charm to a multitude of everyday phrases.

Love it or loathe it, the word has power; one that, when used, knowingly or not, alludes to the inherent natural power of the body part it describes. Perhaps it is right then, that it should be reclaimed back into common usage, that women who use it should be able to access that power more freely through its use. After all, it is arguably infinitely more preferable than its generally unoffending cousin, vagina, deriving as it does from the Latin for sheathe or scabbard, and implying that a woman is nothing more than a receptacle for the all-important sword.
